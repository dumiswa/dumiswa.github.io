        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          IceAge is a short puzzle-adventure game developed in a team of 7 for a university project in collaboration with an after-school care company, where I was one of the two Engineers 
          that workes on this project. The game was inspired by stories and characters imagined by children while trying to create a similar experience to <strong>Captain Toad</strong>.
          Players traverse icy levels, collect crystals, and interact with environmental systems, all within a robust custom Unity framework.

        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
          The game's foundation was built around a centralized but highly decoupled architecture. Each gameplay system could be independently toggled, initialized, and maintained. This 
          approach helped with debugging, testing individual components, and scaling up development as complexity increased. It also ensured cleaner separation of concerns across the team.

          Monolith-Based Interaction Model  
          <i class="fas fa-up-right-from-square"></i>
        </a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        At the heart of IceAge's environmental interaction is a monolith system — a modular design that acts as a bridge between in-world triggers and abstract game logic. Each element 
        in the world that can trigger behavior (like pressure plates, switches, or interactables) is treated as a self-contained logic block that communicates with the central game state. 
        These monoliths could register themselves at runtime and receive signals, allowing designers to build complex interactions without tightly coupling gameplay code. The flexibility 
        of this system proved critical in building puzzles and level events quickly and cleanly.

           State-Driven Systems

        </a>
      </h2>
        <p>
          The gameplay loop, enemy logic, player behavior, and UI interactions were driven entirely by state machines. Each domain managed its own transitions and logic flow, making 
          systems easier to extend and reason about. Cutscenes, menus, and level progressions were all handled through state transitions that made control over flow and logic explicit.

      </h2>
        <p>
          Game state, player progression, and level completion were persisted using a custom-built serialization system. This setup allowed automatic syncing between runtime data and disk 
          state while keeping the save logic abstract and reusable. This also supported multiple entry points into the game world and persisted collectibles and progress across sessions.

          Custom Tooling

        </a>
      </h2>
        <p>
          To improve iteration speed and streamline level design, I built several editor extensions. These tools allowed non-programmers to configure enemy patrol routes, visualize gameplay
          triggers in the scene, and manage debug visual volumes. The tools were integrated directly into the Unity Editor, significantly increasing team productivity.

          UI and Player Feedback

        </a>
      </h2>
        <p>
          In-game feedback was handled via a modular popup system that queued visual messages for the player. This system supported stacked tutorials, tips, and event-driven alerts,
          all decoupled from the game logic. It improved onboarding and helped guide the player through the different puzzle mechanics without breaking immersion.

        <h1>What I Learned</h1>
        <p>
          Working on IceAge gave me a deeper appreciation for systems thinking and modular design. I learned how important it is to design with flexibility in mind, especially 
          in a collaborative team environment where different people need to plug into the same framework. I also gained experience building practical Unity tooling that sped up 
          iteration, and I improved my ability to balance clean architecture with fast prototyping under tight deadlines. Above all, it taught me how to structure game logic in a
          way that is easy to scale, debug, and communicate to others.
