          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>
            This tower defense game was a solo university project I created during my Software Architecture course. I wanted to
            go beyond a simple gameplay prototype and really focus on building something architecturally sound. Players place,
            upgrade, and destroy towers in order to defend against increasingly challenging waves of enemies. Everything from
            tower interaction to UI and spawning was designed to be modular and event-driven.

        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
          When I started this project, I knew I wanted a system where all the gameplay components could communicate cleanly 
          without depending directly on each other. So I designed the core systems like wave control, shop UI, tower upgrades to
          use event broadcasting and singleton managers. This made it easier to manage and test each part individually, and it
          also kept the codebase clean and scalable.
        </p>

            Event-Driven UI System

        <p>
          I decided early on to build a centralized event handler for UI interactions. The <strong>UIEventHandler</strong> script exposes events for everything — tile clicks,
           tower approval, weapon selection, etc. By using C# actions and delegates, I avoided tight coupling between systems and gave myself flexibility to expand the UI 
           later without refactoring everything.

        <p>
          For the wave system, I used coroutines to control timed enemy spawning. Each wave gets more difficult, and I track the number of enemies spawned and destroyed to 
          determine when a wave ends. I also built in win/lose condition checks based on how many enemies make it through — it was a fun challenge balancing the game logic 
          with real-time feedback.

        <p>
          I used ScriptableObjects to define different tower types and their stats. This way, adding a new tower type only required filling in some fields — no extra code 
          needed. I also created upgrade logic that updates both visuals and functionality in the game. The system supports full upgrades, stat previews, and tower destruction via UI.

          The <strong>GameManager</strong> is the central place where I control game-wide variables like money, time scale, and victory/defeat states. I wanted to make sure 
          everything global had a single source of truth, and this class also interacts with UI updates and reset functionality. I also added a speed toggle for testing 
          purposes — which ended up being surprisingly useful!

          One of the things I enjoyed most was building the selection system. I used raycasts to detect which tile or tower the player clicked on, and I highlighted tiles 
          visually. I also made sure the selection and interaction logic was reusable and handled edge cases like clicking on already-placed towers or selecting tiles mid-shop interaction.

        <h1>What I Learned</h1>
        <p>
          This project really helped me think more critically about architecture in Unity. I learned how to design systems that talk to each other cleanly using events,
           and how to avoid writing spaghetti code by breaking things into focused managers. I also became more confident in using ScriptableObjects to separate data from 
           logic. Overall, this was one of the most rewarding solo projects I’ve built so far.
